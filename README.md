# Computational Mathematics Notes

This is a series of notes about the very broad subject of
computational mathematics. The notes are organised into 
jupyter notebooks. 


## Creating a book

You can create a book from the notes using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. 
You can preview the book by using 

```
quarto preview
